<h1>What is HTML and what can it do?</h1>
<p>You've now created two files ending with <em>.html</em> and have heard that they're a
foundation of web development,but... what exactly <em>is</em> HTML? Well, it's short for
<strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, but that still doesn't tell us very much.</P>

<p>So let's take a step back and look at HTML in context. Did you know that it's just one
of the three languages that web browsers speak?</p>

<p>We won't work with the other two in this lesson, but we're introducing them all now to
give you an idea of where HTML fits in and what you can (or can't) do with it.</p>
<h2>The three language of the web</h2>

<strong>HTML</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsibility</strong>: what's on the page</li>
  <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>headlings</li>
      <li>paragraphs</li>
      <li>links</li>
      <li>images</li>
      <li>lists</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Looks like:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Vfyr1aB.jpg" target="_blank">
          <img src= "http://i.imgur.com/Vfyr1aB.jpg" alt="Cat picture">
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
